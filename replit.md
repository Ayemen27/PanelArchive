# aaPanel - لوحة تحكم الخادم

## Overview
aaPanel is a powerful server management control panel built with Python/Flask. It provides a graphical web interface for easy server administration, aiming to be a robust, multi-environment solution for both development (Replit) and production (VPS). Key capabilities include multi-database support (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL), advanced security features, and a scalable architecture. The project's vision is to simplify server management for a wide range of users, from developers to system administrators, leveraging its flexibility and open-source nature to capture a significant market share.

## System Architecture
The project uses Python 3.12 and the Flask framework, served with Gunicorn in production. Core architectural decisions include a Factory Pattern for configuration management, an environment detector for runtime identification (Replit or VPS), and a validator for configuration.

**Key Architectural Features:**
-   **Multi-Environment Support:** Distinct configurations for Development (Replit, SQLite) and Production (VPS, external MySQL/PostgreSQL, Nginx, systemd).
-   **Configuration Management:** Dynamic settings loading via `BaseConfig`, `DevelopmentConfig`, and `ProductionConfig`.
-   **Environment Detection:** Automatic detection of Replit vs. VPS environments.
-   **Containerization:** Multi-stage `Dockerfile` with Gunicorn and `GeventWebSocketWorker`. Docker Compose for orchestration with PostgreSQL and Redis. Blue-Green deployment strategy for zero-downtime deployments.
-   **UI/UX:** Graphical web interface for server management.
-   **Security:** Enforces `SECRET_KEY`, supports SSL/TLS, and uses `.dockerignore`.
-   **Nginx Configuration:** Comprehensive Nginx setup for HTTPS, WebSocket proxying, security headers, rate limiting, and performance optimizations.
-   **systemd Integration:** Advanced `systemd` unit file (`aapanel.service`) for managing Gunicorn in production as a non-root user, with robust restart policies and security hardening.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions for automated testing (pytest, coverage, security scanning), linting/formatting, multi-platform Docker image builds, and automated Blue-Green deployments to VPS, including rollback and health checks.
-   **Database Migrations:** Alembic and Flask-Migrate for managing database schema changes with validation.
-   **Database Backup Strategy:** Comprehensive backup system for SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, featuring automatic scheduling, integrity verification, and security measures.
-   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Health & Readiness Endpoints (`/health/live`, `/health/ready`, `/health/metrics`) for probes and Prometheus metrics. Integrated with Prometheus and Grafana for visualization. Alerting system via Prometheus Alertmanager with 11 alert rules, notifications via Slack and Email.
-   **Centralized Logging:** Grafana Loki and Promtail for centralized log aggregation. Loki runs as an internal-only service. Promtail collects logs from Docker containers, application, and system logs with metadata enrichment. Features structured JSON logging, 7-day retention, and a comprehensive Grafana dashboard. Log rotation is configured.
-   **SSL/TLS Security:** Comprehensive SSL/TLS configuration achieving A+ rating, featuring TLS 1.2/1.3 only, modern cipher suites, OCSP Stapling, and security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP). Let's Encrypt integration with automatic renewal. Includes validation tools (`ssl_check.sh`, `test_ssl_renewal.sh`).
