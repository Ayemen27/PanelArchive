# aaPanel - لوحة تحكم الخادم

## Overview
aaPanel is a powerful server management control panel built with Python/Flask, offering a graphical web interface for easy server administration. The project aims to provide a robust, multi-environment solution for both development (Replit) and production (VPS) deployments, focusing on ease of use, security, and maintainability. Key capabilities include multi-database support (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL), advanced security features, and a scalable architecture. The business vision is to provide a comprehensive, user-friendly control panel that simplifies server management for a wide range of users, from developers to system administrators, with ambitions to capture a significant share of the server management software market due to its flexibility and open-source nature.

## System Architecture
The project leverages Python 3.12 and the Flask framework, served with Gunicorn for production environments. Core architectural decisions include a Factory Pattern for configuration management (`config_factory.py`), an `environment_detector.py` for runtime environment identification (Replit or VPS), and `env_validator.py` for configuration validation.

**Key Architectural Features:**
-   **Multi-Environment Support:** Distinct configurations for Development (Replit, SQLite, DEBUG True) and Production (VPS, external MySQL/PostgreSQL, Nginx, systemd, DEBUG False).
-   **Configuration Management:** `config_factory.py` provides `BaseConfig`, `DevelopmentConfig`, and `ProductionConfig` classes for dynamic settings loading, with `SECRET_KEY` mandatory in production.
-   **Environment Detection:** `environment_detector.py` automatically detects Replit vs. VPS environments.
-   **Containerization:** A multi-stage `Dockerfile` is provided for production, utilizing `python:3.12-slim`, Gunicorn with `GeventWebSocketWorker`. Docker Compose is used for orchestration with `docker-compose.yml` (production) and `docker-compose.override.yml` (development), including PostgreSQL 15 and Redis 7 services. Blue-Green deployment strategy is implemented using `docker-compose.shared.yml`, `docker-compose.blue.yml`, and `docker-compose.green.yml` for zero-downtime deployments with isolated environments and shared services.
-   **Core Files & Structure:** `runserver.py` as the application entry point and `BTPanel/` for core application logic.
-   **UI/UX:** Focuses on a graphical web interface for server management.
-   **Security:** Enforces `SECRET_KEY` in production, supports SSL/TLS, and uses `.dockerignore` for sensitive data.
-   **Nginx Configuration:** Includes comprehensive Nginx setup for production, supporting HTTPS, WebSocket proxying, security headers, rate limiting, and performance optimizations. A two-phase setup script handles initial HTTP-only configuration for ACME challenges, followed by full HTTPS.
-   **systemd Integration:** Advanced `systemd` unit file (`aapanel.service`) for managing Gunicorn in production, running as a non-root user (`www`), with robust restart policies, resource limits, and security hardening. Gunicorn configuration (`gunicorn_config.py`) dynamically calculates workers and supports WebSockets.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implemented via GitHub Actions for automated testing (pytest, coverage, security scanning with Bandit and Safety), linting/formatting (Flake8, Black, isort), multi-platform Docker image builds (GitHub Container Registry, SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning with Grype), and automated Blue-Green deployments to VPS. Includes a robust rollback mechanism and comprehensive health checks.
